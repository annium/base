1. returned value is Result (Annium.Data.Operations)
2. registration is done automatically through assembly discovery
3. each validator is registered as interface implementation
4. validate method returns Result
5. Validator<T> is injected through DI
6. Validator defines sealed Validate method, that uses declared rules to run validation
7. Rules are declared as extension methods (as analogue to extensions.net.http)

- rule - it's function
- rule chain - chain of rules for execution stage
- rule container - container of rule chains for field
- validator - container for field rule containers
- validation executor - executes actual validation
